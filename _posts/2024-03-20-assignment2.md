## Introduction

When considering which author and works to analyze for this assignment, my mind immediately gravitated towards Jane Austen. There's something about her unparalleled ability to depict the nuances of Regency-era society, particularly in matters of etiquette and social interactions, that really interests me. As I pondered over the many options, I found myself drawn to Austen's works not only for their literary merit but also for their inherent charm and wit. It was important for me to choose a work that was originally written in English. I really wanted to analyze my favorite fairy tales by the authors such as Charles Perrault for example, but still, the works written in English in the original were more intriguing for language analysis. Instead of opting for the famous "Pride and Prejudice," a novel I know by heart, I felt compelled to explore Jane Austen's other works, those that offer a glimpse into the subtleties of everyday life and relationships.

Jane Austen, one of the most celebrated authors in English literature, is renowned for her keen insights into human nature, sharp wit, and observations of society. Born on December 16, 1775, in Steventon, Hampshire, England, Austen's works have left an indelible mark on the literary world, despite her relatively short life. Her novels continue to captivate readers worldwide with their rich characterizations, intricate plots, and timeless themes.

In this task, I will delve into Austen's works "Sense and Sensibility," "Persuasion," and "Emma," using digital textual analysis tools to uncover deeper insights into Austen's themes, characters, and narrative techniques. Through Voyant Tools and other resources, I aim to gain a deeper appreciation of Austen's literary genius and the enduring relevance of her works in the 21st century.

### Selected Works and Analysis with Voyant Tools

The word clouds for the works below are based on the 50 most common words, with stopwords such as "like," "and," "it," "she," "he," "said," and others removed beforehand.

> It's common to see "Miss," "Mrs.," and "Miss" repeated frequently in word clouds for Jane Austen's works, reflecting the prominence of these titles in the characters' dialogue and descriptions, and the *societal norms of the time.*


**Sense and Sensibility:** Published in 1811, "Sense and Sensibility" is Austen's debut novel, which explores the contrasting temperaments of the Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne. Set against the backdrop of Georgian England, the novel delves into themes of love, betrayal, and resilience as the sisters navigate the challenges of romantic entanglements and societal pressures.

The word cloud generated for Jane Austen's "Sense and Sensibility" provides valuable insights into the thematic and narrative elements of the novel. The prominence of character names and titles like "Colonel," "Elinor," and "Marianne" suggests a focus on key individuals and their interactions within Regency-era society. Additionally, words such as "sister," "mother," and "family" underscore the importance of familial relationships and domestic life in the narrative, highlighting the interconnectedness of characters and the influence of family dynamics on their experiences. "Sense and Sensibility" explores how money impacts women, which might explain why the word "house" is frequently repeated in analyses like word clouds. When the father dies suddenly, his property goes to the oldest son, leaving his second wife and daughters with nothing. The older son, who is already married, doesn't care about his stepmother and stepsisters. This leaves them in a difficult situation, without any support for their future. Terms like "heart," "time," and "young" evoke the setting and atmosphere of the novel, set in the Regency era, a young lady's future is often tied to the notion of time, especially when it comes to inheritance and marriage prospects. Austen's skillful writing, elegant and precise, adds authenticity and depth to the novel, making it easier for readers to connect with the Dashwood family's story.


**Emma:** Written in 1815, "Emma" is a masterpiece that revolves around its main character, Emma Woodhouse. Unlike other heroines in Jane Austen's novels, Emma is a young noblewoman who embarks on a unique journey of self-discovery. Throughout the story, Emma meddles in the romantic lives of those around her while remaining unaware of her own feelings. As the plot unfolds, Emma learns from her mistakes and grows as a person, coming to understand herself and her relationships better. One can classify Austen's work as a novel of education, as Emma grows up and faces life's circumstances. She realizes her delusions and mistakes and finds the right tone in her relationships with people.

I was particularly interested in that piece. I have never read the novel itself before, however, I started watching the movie based on this book. On the web, I came across interesting information; they say that Jane Austen herself did not value her 1816 novel *Emma* very highly: it’s just that after reading it in the family circle, she did not receive praise and enthusiastic statements. However, it was in this mature work that the writer’s talent manifested itself especially clearly; her ironic mind created memorable and recognizable images that will be of interest to modern readers. The English novelist is distinguished by her good knowledge of human nature and the ability to show common shortcomings with humor.

An ironic novel about a young woman who constantly interferes in other people's personal affairs and wooes her friends. Emma is neither poor nor married. She is a big dreamer and does not strive to become a wife; instead, the girl finds life partners for her friends and arranges weddings. Busy with others, Emma almost misses her chance at love.
Austen's meticulous attention to character names underscores the importance of propriety and decorum in interpersonal relationships, with characters often adhering to societal expectations in their interactions. Hopeful words like "hope" and "wish" reveal characters' desires.  Words such as "friend," "soon," and "time" highlight the centrality of relationships and the passage of time in Austen's narratives. Despite her good intentions, Emma's attempts at matchmaking often lead to unintended consequences, highlighting the complexities of human relationships and the importance of self-awareness. Positive adjectives like "good" and "better" contribute to the nuanced portrayal of characters and the use of archaic language like "shall" adds authenticity to Austen's depiction of the era, immersing readers in the formalities and language conventions of the time.

**Persuasion:** Written towards the end of Austen's life and published posthumously in 1817, "Persuasion" is a poignant tale of second chances and lost love. The novel follows Anne Elliot, a woman who must confront the consequences of her decision to reject a suitor years earlier, as she navigates the complexities of family dynamics and the pursuit of happiness.

In the "Persuasion" word cloud, you'll see names like Anne and Elliot, showing their importance. "Captain" probably refers to Captain Wentworth. Other words like "lady" and "little" might relate to social status, while "soon" could be about Anne's anticipation. "Think" might show Anne's intelligence.

Using tools like 'dreamscape' in Voyant Tools, we can explore where places mentioned in texts are located on a map. But it's interesting that sometimes, even when a story is set in England, American cities show up on the map. This happens because some cities in America and England have the same names. While it's neat to see these connections between distant places, it also means we need to be careful when interpreting the data. We have to make sure we understand the context well to figure out which city the text is really talking about. This mix of literature and geography shows us how connected the world can be, but it also reminds us to dig deeper to get the full picture.

Differences in the ways the word clouds visualize the words include variations in word frequency, prominence of character names or thematic terms, and overall thematic focus. For example, the word cloud for "Sense and Sensibility" may emphasize family relationships and domestic settings, while the word cloud for "Persuasion" may highlight themes of love and longing. These differences reflect the unique thematic and narrative elements present in each work.
