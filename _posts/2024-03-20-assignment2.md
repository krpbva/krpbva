## Introduction

When considering which author and works to analyze for this assignment, my mind immediately gravitated towards Jane Austen. There's something about her unparalleled ability to depict the nuances of Regency-era society, particularly in matters of etiquette and social interactions, that really interests me. As I pondered over the many options, I found myself drawn to Austen's works not only for their literary merit but also for their inherent charm and wit. It was important for me to choose a work that was originally written in English. I really wanted to analyze my favorite fairy tales by the authors such as Charles Perrault for example, but still, the works written in English in the original were more intriguing for language analysis. Instead of opting for the famous "Pride and Prejudice," a novel I know by heart, I felt compelled to explore Jane Austen's other works, those that offer a glimpse into the subtleties of everyday life and relationships.

I have never read the novel itself.  However, I started watching the movie based on this book, that is why it really interested me for some time.  On the Internet, I came across interesting information; they say that Jane Austen herself did not value her 1816 novel *Emma* very highly: it’s just that after reading it in the family circle, she did not receive praise and enthusiastic statements. However, it was in this mature work that the writer’s talent manifested itself especially clearly; her ironic mind created memorable and recognizable images that will be of interest to modern readers. The English novelist is distinguished by her good knowledge of human nature and the ability to show common shortcomings with humor.

The main character of the work is the young noblewoman Emma Woodhouse, who, before the reader’s eyes, goes through a path of development: she realizes her delusions and mistakes and finds the right tone in her relationships with people. One can classify Austen's work as a novel of education, as Emma grows up and faces life's circumstances.

*Background Information on Emma*

Jane Austen's witty and insightful portrayal of provincial society shines through in *Emma,* as she deftly explores themes of class, marriage, and the role of women in society. The novel is characterized by its richly drawn characters, engaging plot, and Austen's trademark irony and wit.

Despite initially being underrated by its author, *Emma* has since garnered widespread acclaim and is considered one of Austen's masterpieces. Its enduring popularity speaks to the timeless appeal of Austen's storytelling and her ability to capture the essence of human nature with unparalleled insight.
