## Introduction

When considering which author and works to analyze for this assignment, my mind immediately gravitated towards Jane Austen. There's something about her unparalleled ability to depict the nuances of Regency-era society, particularly in matters of etiquette and social interactions, that really interests me. As I pondered over the plethora of options, I found myself drawn to Austen's works not only for their literary merit but also for their inherent charm and wit. It was important for me to choose a work that was originally written in English. I really wanted to analyze my favorite fairy tale authors such as Hans Christian Andersen or Charles Perrault, but still, the works written in English in the original were more intriguing for language analysis. Instead of opting for the ubiquitous "Pride and Prejudice," a novel I know by heart, I felt compelled to explore Austen's other works, those that offer a glimpse into the subtleties of everyday life and relationships.


Jane Austen, one of the most celebrated authors in English literature, is renowned for her keen insights into human nature, sharp wit, and astute observations of society. Born on December 16, 1775, in Steventon, Hampshire, England, Austen's works have left an indelible mark on the literary world, despite her relatively short life. Her novels continue to captivate readers worldwide with their rich characterizations, intricate plots, and timeless themes.
