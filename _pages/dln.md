title: "Digital Literacy Narrative"
---

As a junior at **NYUAD** majoring in **Interactive Media** with minors in **Environmental Studies** and **Art History**, I find myself on the precipice of a thrilling journey into the realms of digital humanities. This semester, I eagerly embarked on an introductory course in digital humanities, seeking to broaden my understanding of this dynamic field and to cultivate new digital literacies.
Coming then, I opened a new sphere of interest, something I never heard about before and never thought of learning as a separate chapter.

> As I delve deeper into my studies of digital humanities, the convergence of technology and storytelling emerges as a captivating focal point. Initially, I perceived this domain as primarily concerned with written narratives, confined within the boundaries of letters and sentences. However, through a series of workshops featuring diverse tools and methodologies, my perspective has expanded exponentially.

For instance, the exploration of *Sufi* art revealed profound layers of meaning behind intricate calligraphies, illuminating their significance within the Islamic world. Prior to this encounter, I had never delved into the depths of these artworks, unaware of the rich narratives woven into their very strokes. This revelation underscored the multidimensionality of storytelling within digital humanities, transcending traditional notions of textual narrative.

Moreover, for me , digital mapping in apps like *Kepler* emerged as a cognitive process extending far beyond mere cartography. Through the lens of GIS science, I learned to perceive mapping as a dynamic tool for ordering and interpreting the world. Beyond simple spatial representation, digital mapping facilitates complex analyses and insights, enriching our understanding of geographic phenomena.

Similarly, the importance of data organization learned from the cople of class readings became useful as I navigated through various assignments. Learning to efficiently structure and manage data proved essential for conducting meaningful analyses and uncovering actionable insights. This skill,underscores the critical role of organization in unlocking and accesing the potential of digital information. For exampler, proper naming of things is a key to the best results of the data analysis. 

In tandem with these practical skills, my exploration of digital humanities introduced me to new terminology and concepts. Through Drucker's *The Digital Humanities Coursebook*, I encountered terms such as **tokenization** and **data mining**, each offering insights into the automated analysis of digital content. Tokenization, as discussed in *Chapter 2*, unveiled the process of breaking down text into meaningful units, while data mining, mentioned in *Chapter 7*, illuminated the extraction of patterns and insights from digital files.This process typically involves algorithms and computational techniques to sift through large datasets and extract valuable information. In the context of digital humanities, data mining can be used to uncover hidden connections within texts, visualize patterns in historical data, or analyze trends in cultural artifacts.

My background in interactive media and art history has fueled my fascination with narrative techniques and visual storytelling, and I am eager to explore how digital tools and platforms can enhance and redefine traditional modes of storytelling. I started to be really interested in the power of words, styles of writing and the language of the writers. But with the knowledge gained from this class, I opened myself a new way of viewing everything, a way of analyzing text not only by its meaning, but also by its symbols.
In assignment 1, I had the opportunity to scroll through the digital collections of the **Harvard Art Museum**. Beyond completing the task at hand, this experience provided a gateway to exploring lesser-known works by renowned artists such as **Renoir**. Delving into the sketches of these artists, often overshadowed by their more prominent masterpieces, offered a fresh perspective on their creative processes and artistic evolution. This newfound knowledge not only enriched my understanding of art history but also broadened my appreciation for the diverse facets of artistic expression.

What makes this experience particularly invigorating for me is the opportunity to engage with a diverse cohort of classmates, each bringing their own unique blend of expertise and perspectives to the table.

Before exploring the intricacies of digital humanities, I had already honed my skills in several fields, each providing me with a distinct lens through which to view the digital landscape. Being an interactive technology researcher, I learned creative user-centered design principles and interactive storytelling techniques, often utilizing tools like **Unity** and **Javascript** to bring my visions to life. My passion for environmental studies has equipped me with a keen awareness of data analysis and visualization techniques, crucial skills in understanding and addressing complex environmental challenges. Likewise, my exploration of art history has instilled in me an appreciation for the intersection of technology and creativity throughout history, from the earliest cave paintings to contemporary digital art installations.
However, my foray into digital humanities has illuminated new pathways for exploration and collaboration across disciplines. Through collaborative projects and discussions, I’ve delved into the ethical implications of AI and data usage within my respective fields of study. Also, I’ve grappled with questions surrounding the ethical responsibilities of AI developers and the impact of AI-generated content on storytelling.

For the next part of our semester, I’m excited to continue my exploration of digital humanities and to further develop my digital literacies. Additionally, I am keenly interested in exploring the role of digital humanities in addressing pressing environmental challenges. My studies in environmental studies have underscored the urgency of finding innovative solutions to complex environmental issues, and I believe that digital humanities offers a powerful toolkit for understanding and addressing these challenges. 

> From leveraging data analytics to track and mitigate environmental impacts to using digital storytelling to raise awareness and inspire action, I see immense potential for interdisciplinary collaboration to drive positive change in the world. 

As I continue my journey through digital humanities, I am committed to exploring how technology and the humanities can come together to create a more sustainable and equitable future for all.
In conclusion, my journey through digital humanities has been transformative, challenging me to expand my horizons and rethink the ways in which technology and the humanities intersect. As I continue to navigate the digital landscape, I’m committed to embracing new ways of thinking and working that promote interdisciplinary collaboration and responsible digital citizenship. In the age of AI, I’m confident that my experiences in digital humanities will empower me to navigate the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
