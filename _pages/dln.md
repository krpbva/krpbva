As a junior at NYUAD majoring in Interactive Media with minors in Environmental Studies and Art History, I find myself on the precipice of a thrilling journey into the realms of digital humanities. This semester, I eagerly embarked on an introductory course in digital humanities, seeking to broaden my understanding of this dynamic field and to cultivate new digital literacies.

As I delve deeper into my studies of digital humanities, I am particularly drawn to the intersection of technology and storytelling. My background in interactive media and art history has fueled my fascination with narrative techniques and visual storytelling, and I am eager to explore how digital tools and platforms can enhance and redefine traditional modes of storytelling. From immersive narratives to interactive experiences, the possibilities are endless, and I am excited to experiment with new mediums and techniques to craft compelling narratives that resonate with audiences across diverse digital landscapes.

What makes this experience particularly invigorating for me is the opportunity to engage with a diverse cohort of classmates, each bringing their own unique blend of expertise and perspectives to the table. From computer science enthusiasts to literature aficionados, our collective majors span a wide spectrum of disciplines, reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of digital humanities itself.

Before delving into the intricacies of digital humanities, I had already honed my skills in several fields, each providing me with a distinct lens through which to view the digital landscape. As an Interactive Media major, I've delved deep into user-centered design principles and interactive storytelling techniques, often utilizing tools like Unity and Javascript to bring my creative visions to life. My passion for environmental studies has equipped me with a keen awareness of data analysis and visualization techniques, crucial skills in understanding and addressing complex environmental challenges. Likewise, my exploration of art history has instilled in me an appreciation for the intersection of technology and creativity throughout history, from the earliest cave paintings to contemporary digital art installations.

However, my foray into digital humanities has illuminated new pathways for exploration and collaboration across disciplines. Through collaborative projects and discussions, I've delved into the ethical implications of AI and data usage within my  respective fields of study. Also, I've grappled with questions surrounding the ethical responsibilities of AI developers and the impact of AI-generated content on storytelling. 

Looking ahead, I'm excited to continue my exploration of digital humanities and to further develop my digital literacies. This semester, I aim to deepen my understanding of text analysis and data visualization techniques, exploring new tools and methodologies that will enhance my ability to critically engage with digital content. Additionally, I'm eager to collaborate with my classmates on interdisciplinary projects that push the boundaries of our respective fields and foster innovation and creativity.

Additionally, I am keenly interested in exploring the role of digital humanities in addressing pressing environmental challenges. My studies in environmental studies have underscored the urgency of finding innovative solutions to complex environmental issues, and I believe that digital humanities offers a powerful toolkit for understanding and addressing these challenges. From leveraging data analytics to track and mitigate environmental impacts to using digital storytelling to raise awareness and inspire action, I see immense potential for interdisciplinary collaboration to drive positive change in the world. As I continue my journey through digital humanities, I am committed to exploring how technology and the humanities can come together to create a more sustainable and equitable future for all.


In conclusion, my journey through digital humanities has been transformative, challenging me to expand my horizons and rethink the ways in which technology and the humanities intersect. As I continue to navigate the digital landscape, I'm committed to embracing new ways of thinking and working that promote interdisciplinary collaboration and responsible digital citizenship. In the age of AI, I'm confident that my experiences in digital humanities will empower me to navigate the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
